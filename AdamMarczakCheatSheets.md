### Cloud Computing

Service delivery model over the internet (cloud). This includes but is not limited to

- **compute power** meaning servers such as windows, linux, hosting environments, etc.
- **storage** like files and/or databases
- **networking** in azure but also outside when connecting to your company network
- **analytics** services for visualization and telemetry data

### Key concepts

- **scalability** is the ability to scale, so allocate and deallocate resources at any time
- **elasticity** is the ability to scale dynamically
- **agility** is the ability to react fast (scale quickly)
- **fault tolerance** is the ability to maintain system uptime while physical and service component failures happen
- **disaster recovery** is the process and design principle which allows a system to recovers from natural or human induced disasters
- **high availability** is the agreed level of operational uptime for the system. It is a simple calculation of system uptime versus whole lifetime of the system.
  - availability = uptime/(uptime + downtime)

### Economies of Scale

The principle of economies of scale states that as the companies grow they become more effective at managing shared operations. Be that HR and hiring, taxes, accounting, internal operations, marketing, big purchases via contracts meaning better discounts, etc. etc.

Because of those, companies can save/earn more which in return allows for reduction in cost of their services to their customers. This is so called ‚Äòprice per unit‚Äô.

It‚Äôs not possible to go to 0 because in the end some underlying infrastructure needs to run to provide the services. But the larger the scale the more benefits can be passed to customers.

In fact, in the current scale, Microsoft can already offer multiple services for free due to how small a fraction of the cost it is for them.

## What is a consumption-based model?

The consumption-based model is a **pricing model** used in the cloud so that customers are only charged **based on their resource usage**.

This model is characterized by

- **No associated upfront cost**
- **No wasted resources** as such **no charges are incurred for unused\* resources**. Unused in this case is different per service. For instance, blob storage that stores any data is considered to be used, as it consumes the storage space. Virtual Machines that are running consume CPU, memory and other resources even if there isn‚Äôt any traffic. Hence they are considered to be used and will incur charges.
- **Pay for what you need**
- **Stop paying when you don‚Äôt**

**Consumption** is the virtual metric used to calculate how much each resource (service) in Azure was used. Each service has many smaller metrics that track its consumption to offer best possible pricing model. Those metrics are tracked on very granular level.

## SLA

**Service Level Agreement** (SLA) is a formal agreement between a service provider and a customer.

**SLA** is a **promise** of a service‚Äôs **availability** (uptime & connectivity). **Availability** is a measure of time that a service remains operational.

- Each Service has its own SLA
- Ranges from 99% to 99.999%
- Free services typically don‚Äôt have an SLA
- Broken SLA means service credit return (discount)

| SLA     | Monthly Downtime |
| :------ | :--------------- |
| 99%     | 7h 18m 17s       |
| 99.5%   | 3h 39m 8s        |
| 99.9%   | 43m 49s          |
| 99.95%  | 21m 54s          |
| 99.99%  | 4m 22s           |
| 99.999% | 26s              |

## Formulas

#### Logical AND - adding dependency

Availability of **S1 AND S2** = Availability(S1) * Availability(S2)

##### Scenario - Azure website with SQL backend db

- Availability = Availability(web) app * Availability(sql)
- Availability = 99.95% * 99.95%
- Availability = 0.9995 * 0.9995
- Availability = 0.99900025
- Availability ~ 99.9%

#### Logical OR - adding redundancy

Availability of **S1 OR S2** = 100% - ( Unvailability(S1) * Unvailability(S2) )

##### Scenario - Two redundant web apps behind a load balancer

- Availability(both-web) = 100% - ( Unvailability(web1) * Unvailability(web2) )
- Availability(both-web) = 100% - ( 0.05% * 0.05% )
- Availability(both-web) = 1 ‚Äì ( 0.0005 * 0.0005 )
- Availability(both-web) = 1 ‚Äì 0.00000025
- Availability(both-web) = 0.99999975
- Availability(both-web) ~ 99.9999%

## Key Items

- **Formal agreement** between **Microsoft** & the **customer**
- Calculated as a **percentage of service availability** (**uptime** & **connetivity**) (a promise)
- Breaking the SLA provides a discount from the final monthly bill (**Service Credit**)
- **Higher tier** services offer better **SLAs**
- **Free** services typically have **no SLA** (0% SLA)
- **Preview** services have **no SLA**
- **Composite SLA** is a combined SLA of all application components

____
